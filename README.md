# AVL-Tree
A Java implementation of an AVL self-balancing binary search tree that stores key-value pairs. 

* The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
* Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases. 
* Insertions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or more tree rotations. 
* [More information on AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)
